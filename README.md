# Slinky ground heat exchanger design & analysis - SGHEDA

Except for the upper few meters, the ground temperature is known to be relatively stable. Besides, the ground temperature is higher than the outdoor air temperature during winter and lower than the outdoor air temperature during summer. This makes the ground as an attractive heat source or sink fo rheat pump systems.
A heat pump using th eground as a source or sink is called a Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP).

Our project aims to develop cost-effective enhanced geothermal systems for energy efficient building retrofitting.
